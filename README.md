# CreateDirectoryWithDate

just some project i tought would be useful... i accidentally made 2 versions one for windows using cmd and the other one using bash
because i will use the system() command in order to create a dir like C:\users\you\>mkdir thisisadirectory creates a directory called thisisadirectory in 
C\users:\you mindblowing, isn't it? (and i do something with time, it kinda happened somehow idk)
for windows you have to use for the path \\ so c++ knows that it should be a path. I may update this for windows, but I mean who uses windows
